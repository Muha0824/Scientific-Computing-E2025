These are my two portfolio submissions for the E2025 Scientific Computing course.

We used Python, NumPy, and Pygame for visualization. Through these projects, I gained insight into simulation algorithms, such as modeling dynamic systems, and improved my logical thinking as a coder. I learned techniques like the leapfrog algorithm and basic program structure for natural science simulations.

Although I still need more practice, these portfolios gave me a solid foundation. After the exam, I plan to work on my own projects that align with my interests and explore simulation and coding in more depth. I understand Pygame is mainly for teaching concepts rather than advanced visualization, but it helped me grasp the fundamentals of algorithmic modeling.
