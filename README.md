These are my two portfolio submissions for the E2025 Scientific Computing course.

We used Python, NumPy, and Pygame for visualization. The projects taught me about simulation algorithms and logical coding. While I still need more practice, I plan to continue with my own projects after the exam that I am truly interested in.
